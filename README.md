This product was built based on research I supervised during the Spring 2022 semester.

A total of 200 facial images (with diverse representation) were collated and classified into 5 emotional classes, namely:
- Happy
- Sad
- Scared
- Angry
- Neutral

Training was performed on Google Teachable Machine, a low-code machine solution.
